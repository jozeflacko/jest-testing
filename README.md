# jest-testing

This is a demo project where I try out correct way how to test classes and components with jest engine.
In src/components/ directory you can find several directories where I make all my tests:
- testing Typescript classes
- Mocking dependecies
- Writing mock files into __mock__ files
- testing react components with enzyme library.
